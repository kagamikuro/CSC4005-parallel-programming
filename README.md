Course Contents 

Parallel programming is used in the industry and academia for making use of multicore systems ranging from modern desktops to supercomputers. This is a practically oriented introduction to parallel computing with a significant parallel programming component. Lectures will cover: basic concepts and terminology; parallel computer memory architectures; parallel programming models; designing and implementing parallel programs including performance analysis and tuning. Practical parallel programming will be in C, using OpenMP and MPI, on a large multicore cluster running under Unix.
  
A major component of the module will be the parallelisation of a serial application program, developing implementations in Open MP and MPI.

Learning Outcomes 

To understand the principles underpinning effective and efficient parallel programs. To understand those factors that influence performance. To appreciate currents trends in parallel computing. To understand the basics of C, MPI and OpenMP. 

Skills 

Students will be able: to analyse and identify the hot spots in a serial application program; to design, implement, experiment with and analyse parallel versions of the application program in OpenMP and MPI; to access and manage their applications on a computer cluster; to present coherently the results of experiments and findings in both written and oral form; to identify, understand and appreciate high level journal papers on parallel computing.
